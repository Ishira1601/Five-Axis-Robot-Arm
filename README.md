Five Axis Robot Arm with Interactive User Inferface

In this research we hope to develop a low cost 5 degrees of freedom manipulator for a study
environment. 
The robot is easily programmable. 
It obtains user input in terms of x, y, z coordinates or angles to Python GUI. 
Given the target coordinates, the robot is able to come
 up with a feasible solution using a method called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse
  Kinematics from a previous study.
The solution will be displayed on the screen.
